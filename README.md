### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in my lab prepared me to an extent but i couldn't complete the assignment due to time. I learnt the basics of javascript an dwas able to implement it in my js file when needed.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have completed all the milestones and customized my website to look more appealing.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I'm glad i was able to learn a lot of things within the short time. I definitely wish i could finish my project and i will still finish it. However, I was really uncomfortable with the timeframe. It was too short.
